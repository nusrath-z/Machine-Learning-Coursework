# Machine Learning Coursework

This repository showcases my experience in machine learning through various assignments that I've worked on during my coursework.
These projects cover key areas including 
- classification
- regression
- neural networks
- transfer learning
- time-series forecasting
- image processing
- clustering.

## Project:
- Fine-tuned ResNet18 to improve cancer classification accuracy from 95% to 99%
- Applied transfer learning to reduce training time by 30%; visualized results with t-SNE


## Assignments:

- **Assignment 1:** Health insurance prediction, lung cancer prediction using scikit-learn and logistic regression.
- **Assignment 2:** Neural networks for BMI and Concrete Strength estimation using PyTorch.
- **Assignment 3:** Transfer Learning (ResNet-18 for Brain Tumor classification) and LSTM for time-series forecasting (Amazon Stock data).
- **Assignment 4:** K-means clustering and image processing for color clustering and image recoloring using scikit-learn.
## 
### Assignment 1:
- **Objective:** Predict health insurance premiums and lung cancer using machine learning.
- **Key Tasks:**
  - Analyze and preprocess data for health insurance and lung cancer datasets.
  - Split data into training and testing sets (7:3).
  - Build a Linear Regression model for health insurance prediction and a Logistic Regression model for lung cancer prediction.
  - Evaluate models using metrics like MSE (for health insurance) and classification report (for lung cancer).

### Assignment 2:
- **Objective:** Develop neural networks for BMI and Concrete Strength estimation.
- **Key Tasks:**
  - Preprocess datasets, split into training and testing sets.
  - Build and train neural networks using PyTorch.
  - Fine-tune the models by adjusting hyperparameters (learning rate, batch size).
  - Evaluate models using classification metrics (BMI) and regression metrics like MSE and MAE (Concrete Strength).

### Assignment 3:
- **Objective:** Apply Transfer Learning and LSTM models for brain tumor classification and stock price prediction.
- **Key Tasks:**
  - Preprocess the Brain Tumor dataset and split it for training.
  - Train a ResNet-18 model from scratch for classification, then apply fine-tuning with pre-trained IMAGENET1K weights.
  - Preprocess the Amazon stock dataset into sequences for LSTM prediction.
  - Train an LSTM model for stock price forecasting and evaluate performance.
  - Compare the performance of the scratch-trained model vs. the fine-tuned model in terms of accuracy, loss, and classification report.

### Assignment 4:
- **Objective:** Implement K-means clustering for color analysis of an image.
- **Key Tasks:**
  - Preprocess the image by normalizing it and visualizing the color space.
  - Apply K-means clustering (with K=5 and K=10) to the image and visualize centroids.
  - Recolor the image using the cluster centroids and plot the results.
  - Evaluate the performance by computing the Mean Squared Error (MSE) between the original and recolored images.
